# Lab-1 Questions

**Questions on integers, integer arrays, character, and character arrays**

1. Write a C main which finds the sum of first n numbers and output it to the screen. Read 'n' from the user.

1. Convert the above code to a function and invoke it in the main.

1. /* Function with a single "value parameter" and a single return value */ Write a function which takes a number as a parameter and returns its digit sum. Call the function in a main program and test it on various input cases (i.e with varying number of digits in the input number; zero included.)

1. Write a function which computes the smallest number in a given array. (Pass the array and length of the array as parameters to the function.) Write a main function which inputs an array of integers, and displays the smallest to the screen.

1. Write a function which inputs an integer array and scales it by a factor 'k'. (Pass the array, length of the array and the scale factor as parameters to the function). Write a main which inputs an array of integers, and displays it before and after scaling.

1. Write a main program which reads a string and counts the total number of characters in the string (Note: Do not use strlen library function)

1. Write a function which takes in a string as a parameter and finds the total number of character 'a' and character 'b' in the string. Show its usage by writing a main program.

1. Write a program to count the number of alphabets and number of white spaces (blanks and tabs) in a given line of input.

1. Write a program to count the number of alphabets and number of white spaces (blanks, tabs, and newlines) in the user provided one or more lines of input.

1. Write a program that reads a line of characters from the user which can include blanks and tabs. The program then copies all the characters to a buffer(array) storing only the non-white space characters. After which the program should display the final buffer to the screen.
