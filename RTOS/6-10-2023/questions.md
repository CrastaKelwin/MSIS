## Lab questions based on CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
Design and implement the following algorithms with a Data structure
of your choice (DS can be either simple integer arrays, or singly
linked lists, or doubly linked lists):
1. FCFS algorithm (you may assume all processes arrive at time zero).
2. SJF algorithm (Assume, the processes may arrive at different
times).
3. Priority algorithm (you may assume all processes arrive at time
zero).
4. Round robin algorithm; assume all processes arrive at zero time
and fix a quantum time unit for the algorithm (say 2 or 3 ms)


In each case output the "Turn around time" as well as the "Waiting
time" of each process. (Note: the total number of processes, their
arrival times, burst times may be input by the user).
Show the output in a user friendly readable way, preferably in a
table format.
